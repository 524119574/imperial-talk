# How to get set up

This was ran with Python 3.6, although I'd expect it to work with most modern versions of Python

* Setup a venv by running: `python -m venv venv`, and jump into it using `source activate venv` (This is for Mac OS, YMMV)
* Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`, note that the reqs may seem excessive, they're mostly from Jupyter though.
* Run `jupyter notebook` to boot up your notebook, if your browser doesn't open just copy the URL instead.
* Comments should guide you the rest of the way, there's a few environment variables you'll need to set, but they're easy enough.
